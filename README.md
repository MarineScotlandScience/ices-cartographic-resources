Point data is centroids of geographic units. Line data is the outlines of geographic units with land removed for cartographic purposes. Polygon data is geographic units with land removed, or excludes rectangles exclusively inland.  

The land shapefile used for erasing is a combination of EEA Analytical Coastline https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-coastline-for-analysis-2 and GSHHG http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/
